                "content": "<p>Kubota&rsquo;s 4 valve per cylindre 6.1-litre diesel engines have a long piston stroke. The E-CDIS (Central Direct Injection System) produces a combination of power and efficient fuel consumption, less noise and vibration. The common rail system (CRS) controls the injection timing and the amount of fuel injected in stages under high pressure for optimal combustion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Advantageous torque</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kubota engine has an excellent maximum low-end torque at 1,400 rpm. Its performance curve is best in its class and provides advantages for all power take-off (PTO) implements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Clean engine technology</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The robust V6108 engine is equipped with an SCR exhaust after-treatment system (AdBlue&reg;). The combination of this technology with a diesel particulate filter (DPF) muffler and an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system ensures that the M7001 clearly exceeds the requirements of the latest Stage IV Final emission standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Lower fuel consumption</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The four-cylinder engine in the M7001 has a very efficient fuel consumption for its power. Lower fuel demand, together with reduced AdBlue&reg; consumption, results in long operating times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More power with Power Boost</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The M7001 offers additional power to maintain maximum working performance. If a short-term performance increase is needed for exceptionally heavy work during PTO or transport applications, the M7001&rsquo;s Power Boost will immediately deliver more power to the tractor.</p>\r\n",

All control levers, switches, and buttons in the cab are arranged logically, are easily recognisable, and within comfortable reach. The large LCD display on the dashboard provides a clear and precise overview of all the information required for operating the tractor. Even a first-time driver will appreciate the easiness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The perfect command centre</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The spacious cab is amongst the largest in its category. On top of outstanding spaciousness, it also has great comfort, an impressive operating concept, and exceptional panoramic visibility, allowing you to focus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Optimal comfort on long work days</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Front axle and cab suspension serve to treat both driver and machine with care, resulting in high productivity. The M7001 is available without cab suspension, or can be supplied with two different suspension options: a mechanical suspension system or a pneumatic suspension system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Choice of cab suspension</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cab of the M7001 offers a mechanical suspension system as an option. A pneumatic suspension system is also available. The cab suspension has +/&minus;45 mm of spring travel and reliably softens even hard impacts while underway &ndash; either on the road or in the field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Peace and quiet</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The well-insulated cab (72 dB(A)) lets in very little noise enter.

The optional front axle suspension of the tractor helps to apply greater force to the ground. The tractive power is optimally transferred &ndash; an advantage when ploughing heavy soils, among other things. The front axle suspension not only results in better traction and more driving comfort, but also ensures safe driving behavior. This provides additional safety for faster road travel.

Auto PTO disengages the PTO shaft automatically for headland turns, when the three-point hydraulics system is lifted, and engages it again automatically when lowered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PTO shaft and front linkage on request</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The M7001 can be optionally equipped with a front PTO shaft with 1,000 rpm PTO speed.
