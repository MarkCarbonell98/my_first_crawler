                "content": "<p>Kubota&rsquo;s 4 valve per cylindre 6.1-litre diesel engines have a long piston stroke. The E-CDIS (Central Direct Injection System) produces a combination of power and efficient fuel consumption, less noise and vibration. The common rail system (CRS) controls the injection timing and the amount of fuel injected in stages under high pressure for optimal combustion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Advantageous torque</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kubota engine has an excellent maximum low-end torque at 1,400 rpm. Its performance curve is best in its class and provides advantages for all power take-off (PTO) implements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Clean engine technology</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The robust V6108 engine is equipped with an SCR exhaust after-treatment system (AdBlue&reg;). The combination of this technology with a diesel particulate filter (DPF) muffler and an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system ensures that the M7001 clearly exceeds the requirements of the latest Stage IV Final emission standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Lower fuel consumption</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The four-cylinder engine in the M7001 has a very efficient fuel consumption for its power. Lower fuel demand, together with reduced AdBlue&reg; consumption, results in long operating times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More power with Power Boost</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The M7001 offers additional power to maintain maximum working performance. If a short-term performance increase is needed for exceptionally heavy work during PTO or transport applications, the M7001&rsquo;s Power Boost will immediately deliver more power to the tractor.</p>\r\n",

The tractive power is optimally transferred &ndash; an advantage when ploughing heavy soils, among other things. The front axle suspension not only results in better traction and more driving comfort, but also ensures safe driving behavior. This provides additional safety for faster road travel.
